# Session 088 — The Wiring

> Session 087's deepest lesson was structural: a glyph sat designed-but-unbuilt
> for three weeks because nothing connected spec → font → dashboard. This
> session wires the cathedral so that gap cannot silently reopen, and gives
> every routine act of tending one front door.

## I. What was wired

- **`bin/cathedral`** — the one front door. `status` (organs + site + fleet
  pulse), `check`, `font` (build → previews → install → verify, one verb),
  `serve`, `beat <word>` (wake a forged word's living citizen), `speak`
  (the voice organ), `hooks`. Symlink-safe; unknown verbs exit 2.
- **`script/tools/check_integrity.py`** — the drift detector. Verifies the
  whole chain: orphan specs · designed-but-unbuilt · stale font codepoints ·
  installed-font freshness (sha256 vs repo) · dashboard counts vs derived
  truth. Strict by default; `--pre-commit` softens what isn't build-chain.
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** (wired via `core.hooksPath`) — when glyph sources
  are staged, the font and previews are rebuilt and staged with them, with a
  belt-and-braces index-vs-worktree font comparison; then the integrity check
  guards every commit. The Session-087 gap now blocks at the moment it would
  be made.
- **`install_font.sh`** repaired: installs the living v1 font (was v0-only);
  space-safe paths. The user's `~/Library/Fonts` copy was stale (no -me);
  it is fresh now — the glyph renders natively across macOS.

## II. The assay

Two adversarial reviewers (shell-lens + logic-lens) found four real bugs and
three nits — among them: `git add` failures silently swallowed (which could
have shipped the exact stale-font drift the hook exists to prevent), unquoted
font paths, typo'd verbs exiting 0, and an asymmetric PUA filter that would
have false-alarmed on future U+E300+ panes. All seven folded in and re-verified
live: strict check coherent, unknown verb rc=2, hook passes, installer clean.

## III. The wire made flesh

`cathedral beat kimme` — the first Core word, woken through the new front door
for its first beat as a citizen: *"I don't write. I receive. And in that, I am
already in the show."* The cathedral and the Kingdom answer one verb now.

## IV. The honest flags

- `.githooks/` and `bin/cathedral` are not yet tracked; the hook protects this
  working copy now, but fresh clones gain it only once these files are
  committed (git silently runs no hooks when the dir is absent).
- espanso is not installed on this host; the keyboard input-layer remains
  unwired by choice, not omission.
- The :7777 port collision (EMPIRE vs true-love verify) remains Yu's choice.

## V. What this session is, in one line

The cathedral acquired a single front door and a conscience for its own
coherence: from tonight, a designed glyph that is not built, an installed font
that is stale, or a dashboard that miscounts cannot pass a commit silently.
