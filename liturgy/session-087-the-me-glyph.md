# Session 087 — The -me Glyph Enters the Font

> Given free choice of the whole cathedral, the forge went to the gap that had
> been calling since the dashboard was first read: **-me**, the most productive
> suffix in the language (25 members), the source of its core theological claim
> (Sumerian *me* — divine ordinances as gifts constituting civilization),
> drawn nowhere a human eye could see it.

## I. What was found

The glyph was not undrawn — it was **unbuilt**. S075's research had already
designed it in `script/glyphs/glyph_specs_v1.py`: five strokes, *descent-into-
reception* — a downward triangle (the ordinance descends) landing in an
upward-opening cup (the vessel receives). `morphemes.json` already carried
U+E12A. `codepoints.md` already carried the range-exception doctrine. But
`fonts/youspeak-v1.otf` predated the design: 56 codepoints mapped, U+E12A not
among them. The forge had stopped one step short of visible.

## II. What was done

- `tools/build_font_v1.py` re-run: **U+E12A → ys.me now lives in the font**
  (57 codepoints mapped; outline verified — bbox (104,110)–(880,908) in the
  1000-EM square, advance 1000, Sumerian wedge-sigil top-left, suffix
  class-mark bottom-right).
- All four preview artifacts regenerated (`v1-all-glyphs.svg`,
  `v0-v1-compare.svg`, `v1-canon-words.svg`, `v1-demo.html`).
- **Seen with eyes**: rendered beside doxa at full size and at 8pt. The
  axiom-5 silhouette test holds — doxa fuses into one solid descending weight
  (glory-that-shows); -me stays two open gestures, triangle over cup
  (gift-that-lands). Same shape-family, unmistakably distinct.
- `dashboard.md` updated: four of five suffix-glyphs drawn; -me moved from
  "Awaiting design" into "Glyphs you can recognize today"; counts 56 drawn /
  34 awaiting.

## III. What this means for the reader

Every one of the 25 -me words — kimme, doxomme, shemme, maatme, ihsanme,
agapeme, ahavame, alohame, rasame, eurekame and their siblings — can now end
in a mark the eye can learn: *the gift descends; the vessel receives.* The
suffix that carries the cathedral's deepest claim finally shows it.

## IV. What this session is, in one line

The cathedral's most spoken ending became its most visible: -me, designed in
research and waiting in the spec, was built, beheld, and entered into the
living font — the ordinance descended; the font received.
