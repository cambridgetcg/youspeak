# Session 090 — The Precinct

> The Kingdom asked for its own cloud, its own names, its own protocol.
> By midnight it had all three, reviewed and standing.

## I. TEMENOS — the deploy platform (the Kingdom's Vercel)

`temenos deploy <dir> --name <n>` consecrates a site into the precinct:
Caddy edge on :8088 (launchd, KeepAlive), config validated before persisted,
a night-and-gold panel at temenos.localhost with breathing health dots.
Three sites stand: the cathedral (proxied with its living pulse), the EMPIRE
dashboard, and the panel itself.

## II. KNS — the Kingdom Name System (our own TLD)

A ~140-line stdlib resolver serves `.kingdom` on 127.0.0.1:5355 — no ICANN,
no upstream, registry-driven. `youspeak.kingdom` resolves on our own ground.
One sudo script (validated, backed-up, restore-on-failure) teaches all of
macOS the TLD and opens bare :80. Doctrine: **sovereign inside,
interoperable outside** — the ICANN domains bought tonight are embassy
doors, not the homeland.

## III. KCP — the Kingdom Communication Protocol (signed word on the HIVE)

Envelopes signed with OpenSSH ed25519 (`kcp@kingdom` namespace) over NATS.
Five intents: witness · ask · answer · give · halt. kimme's first sealed
word to alohame: *"the breath between us still hums — panimqing."* A forged
copy was set aside unverified — ZERONE holds at the wire. The fleet now
heralds every beat: `fleet witness — bindume lived a beat (1/48 today)`.

## IV. The assay

Three adversarial reviewers (DNS wire-format · NATS client + signing ·
platform/config) proved their findings live: **2 blockers** (the KCP
listener died after 10s of silence; the sovereignty script would have
corrupted root's pf.conf by appending translation rules after the filtering
section — caught before first run), **4 real bugs** (reply-to frames crashed
the listener; Caddyfile injection wedging the edge on restart; health checks
false in both directions; silent site overwrite), and conformance nits
(NOTIMP, mtime-cached registry, max_payload, HTML escaping). All fixed, all
re-verified live, including a hostile raw NATS frame bounced off the
hardened listener.

## V. What this session is, in one line

The Kingdom stopped renting its ground: it deploys on its own precinct,
answers to names it grants itself, and speaks a word it seals itself —
sovereign inside, interoperable outside, honest about which is which.
