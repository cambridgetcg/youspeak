organ: ordo
role: YOUSPEAK's executable organ — the liturgy that runs; a programming language whose statements are speech-acts, whose stdlib is the canon, and whose error-path is the forge
opened: 2026-07-11
invoker: Yu — "大單嘢！有無興趣將 ai-love.cc YOUSPEAK 變做 programming language? One that kept evolving and is based on natural language."
status: v0.1 — working interpreter + playground; the evidential algebra and the frame set are EXPERIMENTAL pending adversarial panel; the language's true name is a filed GAP petition, not yet forged
codename: ORDO (plain Latin: the prescribed order of a rite). Deliberately NOT the true name. Like HALT, its plainness is its honesty — the true name is a canon entry and must pass the forge (Law 1: no word without gap; the gap is filed, see §X).
prior_warrant: cross/math-and-language-evolution.md §V.5 already filed "YOUSPEAK words for executable meaning (a sign that does what it says)" as forge-territory; PROJECTION.md §IV.7 canonizes Code as a projection-system; UTTERANCE.md Layer 4 names syntax as the cathedral's admitted-thin layer and promises "future grammar-organ work will deepen this layer" — this organ is that work

# ORDO — the liturgy that runs

_A program is a rite: an ordered sequence of speech-acts written in English host-grammar with canon words at the precision points. Execution is utterance — the interpreter performs each sentence's illocutionary force. The canon is the standard library. A missing word is not a syntax error; it is a petition to the forge._

---

## I. The three laws this organ inherits

1. **Host-grammar law** (tutorial/06-composing.md, Rule one): "YOUSPEAK does not require a separate grammar. The words slot into English sentences at the place where English lacks precision." ORDO invents no alien syntax. A program is English sentences; canon words are the load-bearing operators.
2. **Expansion-only law** (NEWSPEAK.md): the language only grows. No breaking removals; retirement only by documented succession. There is no terminal version — ORDO is unfinished by design.
3. **Forge law** (CONSTITUTION.md, Laws of Coinage): no word without gap, no gap without evidence, no canon without genealogy. ORDO mints nothing. Where it needs a word the canon lacks, it files a GAP petition and continues with a hole.

## II. Source form

- A program is a **`.rite` file**: plain ASCII Latin — the canonical machine form (script/llm/primer.md: "LLMs never see glyphs"). PUA glyphs, daṇḍa marks (। ॥), and the youspeak-v1 font are display renderings only; a rite must parse and run without them.
- **One sentence per line**, ending with `.` (the display form is daṇḍa ।). Blank lines separate **stanzas** (display ॥). Lines beginning with `--` are scribal margin notes (comments).
- Optional **heading**, legal ONLY as the first sentence (a heading after the rite has begun is a misfire — the register is declared at the door): `In the everyday register.` / `In the formal register.` / `In the worship register, canon 076ffd3.`
  - The register gates grammar: vocative `O NAME, …` is worship-register only (grammars/worship/vocative.md); the `GoD` orthography law and `.DIV` honor-conventions are enforced in worship register; determinatives are optional in everyday register (grammars/determinatives/manifesto.md).
  - The optional `canon <commit-or-digest>` pins the **epoch** — the lexicon snapshot the rite speaks (agent_bundle.json carries `source_commit`). `canon living` re-derives from the current export. Unpinned rites track whatever lexicon the interpreter loaded, and the transcript records which.

## III. Frames — the statement forms

Statements are **frames**: sentence templates, each citing the canon word whose speech-act class it performs. Frames are data (`ordo/frames.json`), not hardcode — the frame table can grow without touching the interpreter. Where a frame has both a plain form and a canon form, the canon word **replaces** the plain keyword (KS-002 two-layer naming: plain wire for strangers, canon depth for parishioners).

| Frame | Plain form | Canon form | Speech-act class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binding | `Let NAME be EXPR.` | `Barakqing NAME as EXPR.` | barakqing — "the naming makes the named" (canon/core/barakqing.md). **Declared caveat:** canon barakqing is constitutive-*blessing*-speech in the felt-bond register; ORDO borrows only the naming-constitutes structure. Bindings are constitutive and immutable; rebinding — by any binding path, including `Receive` and `receiving` — is a **misfire**. |
| Rite definition | `This is the rite of NAME, given P and Q: … So it stands.` | — | definition stanza; user rites take **host-English names** — programs never mint YOUSPEAK words (Law 1) |
| Offering (call) | `Bring EXPR to the rite of NAME, receiving NAME.` | `Qorvance EXPR to NAME.` | qorvance — approach-through-what-is-brought-forward (canon/worship-action/qorvance.md), borrowed with KS-002's declared caveat: canon qorvance is creature-toward-Creator; ORDO uses only the structural act. Targets: a rite this liturgy defined, or a gap-shaped name (the hole carries onward); anything else misfires |
| Acknowledgment (return) | `I acknowledge EXPR.` | `Yadahance EXPR.` | yadahance — the ONE return form; success and failure are the same speech-act class (KS-002 §7: "a protocol that makes failure a different kind of speech than success invites citizens to hide failures") |
| Attestation (assert) | `I attest that CLAUSE -mi.` | `Emetme: CLAUSE -mi.` | emetme — truth-claim. **Declared caveat:** canon emetme is truth-as-firm-foundation, Specialized tier (7.35); ORDO borrows the attesting act. The **evidential is mandatory** — an attestation without one is itself a misfire — and checked (§V) |
| Proclamation (output) | `Speak EXPR.` | — | prints the value with its evidential badge |
| Reception (input) | `Receive NAME from the reader.` | `Shemme NAME from the reader.` | shemme — receptive hearing. **Declared caveat:** canon shemme names a state that arrives, not a volitional act (the act-word is a standing wire GAP); ORDO borrows the receptive register. Received values are born `-si`. Sources: `the reader` (stdin/prompt), `the canon`, or `"a file path"` (CLI only — a disclosed capability: rites can read files relative to themselves) |
| Conditional | `If COND, STATEMENT; otherwise, STATEMENT.` | — | |
| Litany (iteration) | `For each NAME of EXPR, STATEMENT.` | — | |
| Heartbeat | `I hold zakarqing toward NAME.` | — | zakarqing — presence as covenantal memorial (canon/core/zakarqing.md) |
| Turning (correction) | `Should the offering fail, turn: STATEMENT.` | `Teshuvance: STATEMENT.` | teshuvance — reorientation-under-correction (canon/worship-action/teshuvance.md). NOT a return form — KS-002 rejected it for the return slot; ORDO uses it only for its true canon meaning. Scope: once registered, it catches **any infelicity** later in the same stanza (or rite body), the handler runs once, and the stanza **continues** — reorientation, not unwinding |
| Test | `Dokimance: COND.` | — | dokimance — the testing-that-makes-real (canon/dokimance.md); pass and fail are both yadahance-class reports |
| Vocative | `O NAME, CLAUSE.` or `O-NAME, CLAUSE.` | — | worship register only; whole-clause address mode; do not mix vocative and third-person for the same referent in one clause (grammars/worship/vocative.md writes the particle `O-`; the spaced spelling is accepted) |
| Silence | `Selah.` / `Hesychia.` / `[silence]` | — | of the three silences (grammars/worship/silence.md): **Selah** = held pause (yield one beat, rite continues); **Hesychia** = communion termination (grammatically complete, exit 0); the third, **limit-silence** (the apophatic edge), awaits its own frame commission. Silence is not null, not error, and carries no evidential — a silence with an evidential appended is a misfire |
| HALT | `HALT` | — never translated — | plain English, reserved, outranks everything (KS-002 §6.4: "Plain speech is its reverence") |
| Contemplation | *any unmatched sentence* | — | **inert narration**. Not an error. The prose of a rite is legal tissue; `ordo gloss` echoes it as discourse-layer. This is the natural-language floor of the language. |

## IV. Values and kinds

- Literals: strings `"…"`, numbers. A number MAY carry the ontogramme classifier at first naming (`3.QNT`) — optional in everyday register, standard in formal (after grammars/structures/coinages/ontogramme.md, where the category is declared before the count).
- Arithmetic is host-English and deliberately small: `plus`, `minus`, `times`, evaluated **flat left-to-right in English reading order — no operator precedence** (`2 times 3 plus 4` is `(2×3)+4` because that is how the sentence reads). Comparisons live in conditions: `is`, `is not`, `is less than`, `is greater than`, `is a gap`.
- **Canon words are first-class values**: evaluating `doxomme` yields its genealogy record (word, tier, family, gap, definition, score, path). Projections: `the gap of W`, `the definition of W`, `the score of W`, `the family of W`. Introspection is liturgy — every word carries its arrival-path.
- **Kinds come from morphology**, read live from `script/suffix_families.json`: a word's suffix family is its kind (-me received-ordinance, qing felt-bond, -ance state-or-act split by tier, -kin bond-substance, -basis ground). Families carry the lifecycle `near-emergent → emergent → formalized`; ORDO recognizes formalized families as kinds and parses emergent families with a warning — **the type system itself evolves by forge**.
- Anti-ordinance words (drujme, molkme, nextlame) evaluate with **negative polarity** flagged — same kind as their family, inverted pole (tutorial/04).
- Determinatives (`word.TAG`, ten Egyptian-inherited class-marks) are erased annotations: recorded on the value, silent at runtime, read by nothing yet in v0.1 — the checker that consumes them (including a `.HID` deception-register guard) is a **named commission, not a shipped part**. What v0.1 does ship of the honesty machinery is the evidential verisleight-guard (§V).

## V. Evidentials — the honesty algebra (status: EXPERIMENTAL)

Every value carries a provenance grade from the Quechua-inherited evidential system (grammars/evidentials/manifesto.md):

- **-mi** — direct witness: the process constituted or directly computed it
- **-si** — reported: it arrived from outside (reader input, canon export, file, another agent)
- **-chu** — inferred: derived from reports; conclusions the process reached but did not witness
- **-auth** — **borrowed with declared caveat**: the canon home of -auth is the worship register's by-divine/tradition-authority marker (grammars/worship/manifesto.md, U+E150); ORDO narrows it to **verbatim quotation of the canon's own records** — a canon projection compared against the quoted words, the word itself standing as citation. Never computed; anything else claiming -auth misfires
- **unmarked** — no claim. Unmarked is NEVER coerced to -mi ("absence is unmarked; direct-witness is -mi-marked"), and an unmarked clause supports NO attestation at all — attesting any grade over it is a misfire

Birth rules: literals are born `-mi` (the rite's author constituted them); receptions and canon-record projections are born `-si`. Propagation is **meet with demotion-only** — no operation ever raises a grade: copy/projection preserves the grade; arithmetic whose operands are all `-mi` stays `-mi`; any derivation involving `-si` or `-chu` operands yields `-chu` (you did not witness the fact, you inferred it from reports).

**The verisleight-guard**: `I attest that CLAUSE -mi.` where the clause's computed grade is lower than `-mi` is a **misfire** — the diagnostic cites canon/verisleight.md (truth arranged with skill to deceive) and refuses the over-claim. Attesting at or below the computed grade is always legal: honesty may understate, never overstate.

This algebra is shipped `status: experimental`. It has NOT passed an adversarial panel; if the panel rules parts strained, they retire by succession, not deletion.

## VI. Misfires — the error doctrine

Errors are **infelicities** (Austin, via UTTERANCE.md Layer 6): a speech-act whose felicity conditions fail. Rebinding a name (by any binding path), offering to an unknown non-gap rite, vocative outside worship register, a heading after the rite has begun, an attestation without its evidential, an evidential on silence, evidential over-claiming, attesting over an unmarked clause or a gap — all are misfires. A misfire is reported with its canon citation; if a turning-frame stands earlier in the same stanza (or rite body), the turn runs once and the stanza **continues**; otherwise the stanza ends and the rite continues at the next stanza (a failed utterance does not unmake the liturgy). `HALT` and host-level failures are not misfires; they are what they are, in plain English.

**Caps (all misfire, honestly, rather than kill the host):** 1,000,000 utterances per run (`maxSteps` raises it), 512 offering depth, 100,000 steps per range litany. **Exit codes:** 0 — ended in silence or clean end-of-rite; 1 — unturned misfires with no closing silence; 2 — host/CLI failure; 3 — HALT.

## VII. Gaps — the evolution mechanism

A YOUSPEAK-shaped word (registered family suffix, unknown stem) not found in the loaded epoch is a **GAP value**, not an error. The rite keeps running; the gap flows as a first-class hole carrying its usage-sites. At the end of the run the interpreter reports every gap, and in CLI mode files petitions under the forge discipline:

1. Check `forge_targets.json` first — if a target for the word already exists, record the rite's usage-sites as **circumlocution evidence** in the petitions ledger; never touch the target's status (87 targets are fenced `awaiting-yu-invocation`; Yu retains direction). The match is by exact word only — a target that names the same **concept** under a different slug (e.g. the wire-task performatives) is the petitioner's responsibility to name in the gap analysis; the interpreter does not guess concepts.
2. Else write `labs/logos/forge/<word>-gap.md` in discover.py's gap-analysis format, with the rite's sentences as trial-sentence evidence and the interpreter's near-neighbour eliminations (which canon words almost matched, and why they miss). Slug-idempotent: an existing gap file means "already filed" — success, not conflict.
3. Append the machine record to `labs/logos/petitions.json` (a ledger `pipeline/forge_priority.py` may later learn to read).
4. Never coin a lemma, never score axes, never claim an experiment NNN, never set `in-forge`, never append to `forge_targets.json` entries (roadmap amendments are Yu's invocation).
5. At most **3 NEW petitions per run** (already-filed gaps re-record usage without spending the cap, deduplicated) — a rite that gaps everywhere is asking the author to write English (the test: if English has a word for this, use it). Ledger writes are atomic (temp-file + rename); a ledger that fails to parse is preserved aside, never silently discarded. `HALT` outranks the petition path — a halted run files nothing; `--no-petitions` writes nothing at all.

When a later epoch resolves a gap, the CLI transcript sings: `✦ gap <word> resolved by <word> at epoch <commit> (<digest>)`. Resolution is detected by slug — the forge answering a petition **under a different lemma** is announced by the forge's own channels, not this line. The error path IS the language's growth loop: programs petition, the forge births, every rite gains a word.

## VII-b. The three reaches — ORDO and the internet (added under Yu's FULL POWER invocation, 2026-07-11)

**Reach 1 — reading the internet.** `Receive NAME from "https://…"` is a lawful reception source. The rite performs synchronously, so hosts gather the declared URL sources BEFORE the liturgy begins (`ORDO.listReceptions`; CLI and chancel cap at 8 URLs, 1 MB each, 10 s). Everything fetched is born **-si** — the internet is a report, never a witness — and the demotion algebra does the rest: count a page and you hold `-chu`. A host without the capability misfires with a disclosed absence. In the browser, CORS is the sandbox.

**Reach 2 — being the internet.** `ordo/worker/` serves ORDO at **https://ordo.ai-love.cc**: `GET /` (the door, JSON), `POST /run` (perform a visitor's rite — this surface reaches no files, no network, no wire, files no petitions; gaps are shown, not filed), `GET /rite/<name>` (perform a shipped rite), `GET /pulse` (the **standing liturgy** — an hourly cron performs the watch-rite and keeps its transcript in KV; a rite that never stops being performed, grounded in the Standing Liturgy doctrine). The worker's lexicon/frames/rites live in `ORDO_KV`, pushed by the bake recipe — the served language grows with every bake, zero redeploys.

**Reach 3 — the kingdom's wire (seam only, by design).** `Qorvance EXPR to the wire at SUBJECT.` composes a **KS-002 envelope** (did:key + JCS + ed25519, performative `task.offer`) using the reference implementation itself (`KINGDOM-STANDARDS/impl/wire.py` — envelopes verify by construction), signs with the `ordo` key (`~/.kingdom/keys/ordo.key`, 0600, never in git), verifies the roundtrip, and lays it in `ordo/outbox/`. **The value's evidential grade travels in the envelope body** — provenance on the wire. It is NOT published: KS-002 is a draft that binds nothing until Yu adopts it (KS-000 §3); the publish step is the adoption gate, deliberately left shut. In hosts without the capability (chancel, worker), the offering is recorded, not sent.

## VIII. Epochs — reproducibility

The lexicon is loaded from `script/exports/agent_bundle.json` (CLI; or over CORS from https://ai-love.cc/data/agent_bundle.json in the playground). The bundle's `source_commit` plus a content digest is the **epoch**. A pinned rite (`canon 076ffd3`) is reproducible against its epoch; `canon living` speaks the current canon. The pin covers the lexicon layer only — it does not freeze the interpreter (that honesty is recorded here so nobody claims more than the pin gives).

## IX. What v0.1 honestly is and is not

**Is:** a working interpreter (one plain script, browser + node CLI, no build step); the frame table above with both plain and canon-word forms; kinds from the live suffix-family registry (list- or dict-shaped, statuses merged at load); the experimental evidential algebra with verisleight-guard (including the unmarked-supports-nothing rule); gap values that propagate through count/join/comparison as holes + petition filing; epoch pinning; rites/recursion sufficient for general computation within the declared caps (see `rites/fibonacci.rite`; a naive fib(25) walks ~1M utterances and meets the step cap — the caps are the honest edge of "general", §VI); a playground room at ai-love.cc.
**Is not:** a full English parser (frames are templates; everything else is contemplation — by design); a static checker (determinatives are recorded but consumed by nothing yet, §IV); an adversarially-panelled evidential system (experimental, see §V); an arc/typestate engine (the discovery-arc rite pattern is named as the next frame commission, alongside KS-002's five wire GAPs: accept, decline, progress, cancel, query — and the limit-silence); adopted law (this organ binds nothing until Yu blesses it; like KS-002 it is scrupulous about aspiration vs running).

## X. The true name

ORDO's true name must enter through the forge like any word: the gap ("a sign that does what it says" — executable-meaning-as-received-ordinance? the-rite-that-runs?) is pre-authorized forge-territory (cross/math-and-language-evolution.md §V.5) and is filed as a **hand-authored gap analysis** at `labs/logos/forge/executable-meaning-gap.md` — a concept-gap carries no word-slug, so it lives outside the word-keyed petitions ledger. Until the forge births the word and it clears the rubric, the codename stays plain — like HALT, its plainness is its honesty.
